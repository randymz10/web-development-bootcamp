## What is HTML? 

HTML meaning ***HyperText Markup Language*** and define the content and the structure of a website. The **HyperText** allow to navigate between documents HTML through links inside to the document and the **Markup Language** are tags that wrap the words or element to mark the each part of the HTML document.

## HTML Heading Elements

The headings elements are one of the most important HTML elements they define the titles and subtitles in a website and they're very used, they going to since H1 (the bigger level) until H6 (the smaller level). This elements are compose for the opening tag and the closing tag, the difference between the open tag and the close tag is that the close that have a '/' inside him.

Is a best practice to have only one H1 in the website, so is consider a bad practice to have more than that, also don't jump between headings elements in order to keep a hierarchical sequence.

## HTML Paragraph Elements

The paragraph element serve to separate paragraph from each other, it's very useful to people that use screen reader and are blind, it is identify by the 'p' and to have a opening and closing tags.

## Self Closing Tags (Void Elements)

The void elements are tags that close by itself, they there aren't content inside, therefore, not have a opening or closing tags, the most used are the <hr /> (horizontal line) and the <br /> (break line) both used to separate the HTML element from each other. For convention we use the space and forward slash to improve the readability of our code, but the same way the browser can read our code without this. 

Other thing that we can avoid is use the <br /> to add breaking lines in our paragraph, for that we can add other paragraph element for add new lines, only in specific cases we use the <br /> tag in the same paragraph element. This is useful to impruve our a  accessibility fo the screen readers and blind people.
